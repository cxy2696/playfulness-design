  <h2>Introduction to the Topic</h2>
  <p>What if older adults could develop an intuitive sense for recognizing antiques without prior expertise? This presentation explores how insights from cognitive science, history, and playful design can inform a therapeutic activity to enhance cognition, memory, and engagement in elderly therapy.</p>
  <p>Key Concept: Intuition is the ability to judge properties based on unconsciously activated memory, even without direct experience. It emerges from implicit learning and can be cultivated through targeted activities. For elderly therapy, this translates to reminiscence-based games that stimulate the brain while evoking joy and social interaction, as seen in playful AI designs inspired by antique automata.</p>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Insights from Cognitive Science</h2>
  <p>Cognitive science reveals that intuition is rooted in unconscious recognition memory, often described as a "gut feeling." It's built from learned patterns without deliberate awareness. Academic papers such as "Intuition: a social cognitive neuroscience approach" by MD Lieberman (2000) highlight how intuition functions in social contexts. Additionally, "Intuition and reasoning: A dual-process perspective" by JSBT Evans (2003) discusses the interplay between intuitive and analytical thinking.</p>

        <td>Helps identify antique styles (e.g., Victorian vs. Art Deco) intuitively.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Implicit Memory</td>
        <td>Knowledge gained without conscious effort, aiding quick judgments. As explored in "Scientific knowledge suppresses but does not supplant earlier intuitions" by A Shtulman and J Valcarcel (2012).</td>
        <td>Allows seniors to "feel" an item's age or value based on subtle cues.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Right Hemisphere Role</td>
        <td>Processes holistic insights and gut feelings.</td>
        <td>Supports creative recognition without analytical overthinking.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

  <p>These mechanisms show intuition can be trained, even in older adults, to combat cognitive decline.</p>

  <h2>Insights from History</h2>
  <p>Antique recognition has evolved from ancient collecting in Greece, Rome, and Egypt to modern valuation based on rarity, provenance, and craftsmanship. Relevant academic works include "Empire without end: antiquities collections in Renaissance Rome, c. 1350-1527" by KW Christian (2010), which examines early collecting practices. Another is "A late antique statuary collection at Ostia's sanctuary of Magna Mater" by Douglas Boin, providing insights into late antique collections.</p>
  <p>Historical automata (500-1500 CE) inspire playful reminiscence, such as the Mechanical Monk (1560) with walking and praying motions, or Al-Jazari's Floating Orchestra (1206) for surprises.</p>

  <p>Historical Factors Influencing Value:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rarity</strong>: Limited production increases worth.</li>
    <li><strong>Provenance</strong>: Documented history adds significance.</li>
    <li><strong>Craftsmanship</strong>: Handmade details from eras like Victorian or Mid-Century.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In therapy, historical storytelling around antiques preserves personal and cultural memories, linking to reminiscence therapy that improves cognitive status in seniors.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Insights from Playful Design</h2>
  <p>Playful design integrates fun elements into learning to build intuition through engagement, iteration, and joy. It transforms spaces and activities into skill-building experiences</p>
  <p>Key academic papers include "Principles of adult play(fulness) in contemporary toy cultures: From wow to flow to glow" by K Heljakka (2013), outlining adult play principles.</p>
  <p>Also, "Co-creativity through play and game design thinking" by S Arnab et al. (2019) emphasizes collaborative play in design.</p> 
  <p>"Designing for Playful Math Engagement Across Learning Environments" by C Lee et al. explores playful engagement in education.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Affective + Abstract Motion</strong>: Subtle movements for emotional engagement (e.g., Pinokio Lamp, Mechanical Monk).</li>
    <li><strong>Ludic Activities</strong>: Curiosity and exploration (e.g., Drift Table, Floating Orchestra).</li>
    <li><strong>Mind-Body Push-and-Pull</strong>: Control contests for fun (e.g., Brainball, Digesting Duck).</li>
    <li><strong>Magic Circle</strong>: Enchanted zones for reflection (e.g., Silver Swan).</li>
    <li><strong>Openness and Ambiguity</strong>: Reimagining stories with twists (e.g., The Writer).</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Utilitarian Fun</strong>: Blurring play and life with surprises (e.g., Tipoo's Tiger).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Core Principles:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Active Engagement</strong>: Hands-on interactions foster meaningful learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Interaction</strong>: Group play enhances motivation and memory.</li>
    <li><strong>Iteration and Joy</strong>: Trial-and-error in a fun context builds intuition.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>For games, incorporate familiar elements to make them accessible for older adults.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Application to Elderly Therapy</h2>
  <p>Elderly therapy benefits from activities that stimulate cognition, such as reminiscence with old photos or objects.</p>
  <p>Academic studies like "Effects of Reminiscence Therapy on Cognitive Function in Institutionalized Elderly People with Dementia: Meta-analysis" by S Jun support its efficacy.</p>
  <p>"The effect of group reminiscence therapy on death anxiety and adaptation of the elderly to old age" by Z Faramarzian et al. shows benefits for emotional well-being.</p>
  <p>Antique recognition fits perfectly as a historic activity, promoting memory recall and focus. Playful AI inspired by antiques enhances voluntary involvement and curiosity for older adults.</p>
  <p>Challenges for Seniors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cognitive decline (e.g., dementia).</li>
    <li>Need for low-pressure, enjoyable tasks.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="https://www.homage.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/wordpress-feature-image-24.png?v=1627453922" alt="feature">
  <p>Solution: Blend intuition-building with play to delay memory loss and provide socialization. Games like puzzles or trivia adapted to antiques.</p>

</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Proposed Therapeutic Design - "Antique Intuition Quest"</h2>
  <p>A playful game for older adults:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Format</strong>: Group sessions (4-6 participants) with a facilitator. Use physical antiques or images.</li>
    <li><strong>Mechanics</strong>:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Show an object; guess era, value, or story intuitively.</li>
      <li>Discuss cues (e.g., material, wear) to build patterns.</li>
      <li>Playful twists: Points for creative stories, no wrong answers; add clockwork surprises or random medieval elements.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><strong>Adaptations for Seniors</strong>: Large visuals, simple rules, tied to personal memories. Incorporate gamification like badges for intuition "wins."</li>
    <li><strong>Tools</strong>: Memory boxes with antiques, digital apps for virtual hunts with ambiguity and exploration features.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This design draws from co-design with older adults for relevance. For intuition building in cognitive games, see "Episodic memory visualization in robot companions providing a memory prosthesis for elderly users" by JS Pons et al. (2015).</p>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Benefits and Implementation</h2>
  <p>Benefits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improves memory and focus through reminiscence. As evidenced in <a href=" https://ijip.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/18.01.173.20231101.pdf ">"Effectiveness of Reminiscence Therapy on Levels of Depression Among Elderly at Old Age Home, Tirupathi A.P" by K Raghupathy.</a></li>
    <li>Builds intuition via playful iteration, reducing isolation.</li>
    <li>Enhances well-being with joyful, meaningful activities, including curiosity from antique-inspired surprises.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Implementation Tips:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sessions: 30-45 minutes, 2-3 times/week.</li>
    <li>Evaluation: Track engagement and cognitive scores.</li>
    <li>Scalability: Adapt for home or community centers.</li>
  </ul>
